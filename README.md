C# and Angular Application for Registering Students 

The City Council of Cruziero (Cruzeiro, SP - Brazil) uses a system I developed in Laravel and Angular so they can register teachers and students for their leisure centers.
At some point they were about to change servers so I had to rewrite the Laravel application in C#. It came out pretty decent but the servers were never changed, the Laravel still running so I can open the code for this one.
